# Assignment10
Submission for EMU PHYS380 assignment 10 (final assignment)

As I state in my LaTeX write-up, this program is not truly functional. However, I have run out of time to work on it, so I have to submit it in its current state. I think the issue comes from the calculations for velocity, however, I could not think of a way to fix it. I also included the sources I actually used instead of trying to find proper ones, as again, time constraints. 

This class was a fun experience, and as I said in my conclusion in the document, a skill set I hope to use and retain
